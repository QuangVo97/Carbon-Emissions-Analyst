#### Conclusion: Wind turbines are the highest contributors to carbon emissions, especially the Wind Turbine G128 5 Megawats in 2015, with an astonishing 3,718,044 pcf. Automobiles and vehicles also have a noticeable carbon footprint. The Land Cruiser Prado, FJ Cruiser, Dyna trucks, and Mercedes-Benz models (GLE and S-Class) all show relatively high carbon footprints, with the Land Cruiser Prado in 2016 having 191,687 pcf. Smaller industrial products like the Retaining wall structure (136 tonnes of steel sheet piles) and the Electric Motor have much lower emissions in comparison but still contribute to the overall impact, particularly in heavy construction and manufacturing industries.

#### Conclusion: Several industries have made remarkable progress in reducing their carbon footprints over the years. Automobiles & Components, Electrical Equipment and Machinery, and Pharmaceuticals, Biotechnology & Life Sciences show the most dramatic decreases, with some even reaching zero emissions by 2017. Other industries, such as Media, Software & Services, and Technology Hardware & Equipment, have also made significant strides in reducing their emissions, reflecting a broader trend toward sustainability across various sectors. These reductions could be attributed to various factors, including the adoption of cleaner technologies, improved energy efficiency, better environmental policies, and changes in production practices. However, some sectors still have a long way to go in completely eliminating their emissions, and continued efforts will be needed to drive further reductions.
